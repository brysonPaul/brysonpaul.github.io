          I've been programming since I was in freshman year of high school, and since then I have been captivated.
          Like many, the notion of programming video games was my first inlet to the hobby, but I was soon captivated by the freedom and euphoria of completing any project or problem thrown my way.

        <p className='atext'>
          Ever since, I have been honing my craft to get to the point I am today. But this thirst for knowledge will always be a lifetime goal for me.
